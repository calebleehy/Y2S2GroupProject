# Y2S2GroupProject
Group Project done during Year 2 Semester 2 at NUS

Did first of the 3 descriptive statistics and Visualisation 1 of Question 1, including its corresponding paragraphs in methodology and discussions.

Dataset taken from:
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/readme.md

Tasks:
Your task is to come up with two distinct and meaningful questions, answer each of them
with two visualizations using ggplot2, and write-up your method and findings. You are
expected to give your best effort using tools acquired in class.

Write-up:
1. Introduction (1 paragraph): Briefly introduce the data set. You can repeat some of the data description found on the TidyTudsday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your reader has no prior knowledge about the data set.

2. Descriptive statistics (1-2 paragraphs and a few code blocks): Mention any transformation or cleaning you have applied to the data. Present key descriptive statistics to give a taste of what the data are like. Resist the temptation to report descriptive statistics in bulk and be more selective in reporting only the most interesting/relevant statistics.

3. Question 1: The title should relate to the question you are answering.

• Introduction (1 paragraph): Introduction to the question and which parts of the data set are used to answer the question. Discuss why you are interested in this question.

• Methodology (1-2 paragraphs): Describe the visualizations you make to answer your question. For each plot, explain what variables you are plotting and provide a clear explanation as to why it is the best for providing the information you are
asking about. Two plots for the same question should be of different types.

• Visualizations (2-3 code blocks and 2 figures): In this section, provide the code that generates the plots. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or other plotting packages.

• Discussions (1-2 paragraphs): Describe the primary information you hope the reader will gain from your visualization. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Explore and explain why the data looks the way it does.
